abstract="Every human likes choices. But today's fast route planning algorithms usually compute just a single route between source and target. There are beginnings to compute alternative routes, but there is a gap between the intuition of humans what makes a good alternative and mathematical definitions needed for grasping these concepts algorithmically. In this paper we make several steps towards closing this gap: Based on the concept of an alternative graph that can compactly encode many alternatives, we define and motivate several attributes quantifying the quality of the alternative graph. We show that it is already NP-hard to optimize a simple objective function combining two of these attributes and therefore turn to heuristics. The combination of the refined penalty based iterative shortest path routine and the previously proposed Plateau heuristics yields best results. A user study confirms these results.",

  abstract={This study provides the first global evaluation of both direct and indirect flood hazard impactson road transportation networks. It constructs topological road networks for 2,564 human settlements, representing over14 million kilometers of urban roads. It assesses their exposure to pluvial and fluvial flood risks under 10scenarios, corresponding to different flood intensities (1:5 year to 1:1,000 year return periods). Under each scenario,the study analyzes direct infrastructure exposure and assesses the indirect effects of flood-induced mobilitydisruptions: route failures, travel delays, and travel distance increases. The results document a positiverelationship between flood return period and flood impact (both direct and indirect). Compared with direct floodhazard exposure, the indirect impact of floods on mobility is more prominent and heterogeneous. The average share ofthe road network that is flooded by at least 0.3 meters is 3.64 percent (or 24.84 percent) under the 5-year (or1,000-year) return period, yet 11.58 percent (or 65.67 percent) of the simulated trips fail in the same scenario.The results enable comparisons of exposure and vulnerability of road networks to flood hazards across countries, allowingthe identification and prioritization of urban transport resilience measures.},
